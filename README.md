# Blossom Buffet

**Blossom Buffet** is a 2D single-player stealth-action game made in **Godot 4**, where you play as **Bubu**, a loyal sidekick trying to keep **Blossom**—a sleepy, sensitive dog—safe from falling chaos. Bad food like pickles falls from all directions, and if too many hit her, she wakes up. Game over.

But fear not... you’ve got help. **Dudu**, your mysterious buddy, can slice pickles out of the air—if you hit the spacebar in time.

## 🕹️ Improved from Blossom Run 
## 🕹️ Game Summary

- **Goal**: Catch good food, stop bad food (especially pickles), and keep Blossom asleep.
- **Lose Condition**: Blossom’s health hits 0 → She wakes up → Game ends.
- **Dudu’s Role**: Press `Spacebar` to call Dudu to **cut incoming pickles** before they hit Blossom!

## 🍽️ Gameplay Features

- **Bubu** moves to catch food and protect Blossom
- **Pickles** = bad food that damages Blossom
- **Dudu** cuts pickles with a timely spacebar press
- Food spawns from all directions—requires fast reaction
- If Blossom’s health bar reaches 0, the game ends with her waking up
